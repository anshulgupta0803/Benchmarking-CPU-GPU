6 - 10	This is the kernel code that is called by main function. It allocates a thread ID to the simultaneous processes. Each thread then computes the square root of the elements of the array a_d and place it in the same position b_d.

14		Prints column headers on the screen

17		Loop of 500 is initialized with i starting from 0 ranging to 50000 over a step size of 100

22		This loop computes the square root of the sample for 10 times and the average is the final output of that sample.

32 - 33	Memory is allocated for the array for input and output on host.

35 - 36	Memory is allocated for the array for input and output on device.

38 -39	Input array is populated with the elements. An element of array holds the value equal to its index value.

41		The host input array is copied to the device input array

46 - 47	The kernel code is called with device input array, device output array and number of elements as arguments.

57 - 66	The same process done for GPU is done on CPU.

68 - 85	The output is saved inside a file for reference of the user.

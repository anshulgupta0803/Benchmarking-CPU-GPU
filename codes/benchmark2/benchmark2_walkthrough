8 - 12	The kernel code is called by the main function. The thread index is calculated and the element of the array corresponding to the index is multiplied by 2 and saved in another array.

15- 20	This function is called by host and runs on CPU. Every element is multiplied by 2 and stored in output is stored in another array.

25 - 34	Initializing the variables.

36		Loop of 8000 is initialized with i starting from 0 ranging to 8000 over a step size of 1.

38 - 39	Memory allocation is done for the input and output arrays on host.

41 - 42	Memory allocation is done for the input and output arrays on device.

46 -47	Input array is populated with the elements. An element of array holds the value equal to its index value.

49		Host input array is copied to the device input array.

51		Kernel code is called with device input and output array and the array size as arguments.

52		The threads are synchronized using cudaThreadSynchronize () function.

54		The device output array is copied in the device output array.

57		The host function is called to do the same work done on GPU.

60 - 68	Finally the time taken is calculated and the memory is deallocated.

This project \textbf{"Performance Analysis and Optimization of Individualised CPU-GPU Core Systems"} has been undertaken keeping in minds the heights "Information Technology has reached" and when everything is powered with computers does make a great difference. \\

Initially, the CPUs are responsible for handling all of the computing and instructions that it receives from the user and the system. However, with the increaseof technology and the demand of technology, it was best to take some of the pressure of the CPU and give it other processors. In comparison to CPUs, GPUs have more transistors that can handle more work and offers greater resolutions. Most of the GPUs transistors perform calculation related to 3D technologies. They wereoriginally used to accelerate the memory-intensive work of texturemapping and rendering polygons. Many GPUs also support technologies for advanced gaming or digital playback, offering better and advanced systems. \\

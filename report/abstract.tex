Today's supercomputers are computers of tomorrow and GPU processors are bridge between them today. \textbf{A graphics processing unit} or \textbf{GPU} is a specialized processor that offloads 3D or 2D graphics rendering from the microprocessor.\\\\

\textbf{ GPU computing} is the use of aGPU to do general purpose scientific andengineering computing. The model for GPU computing is to use a CPU and GPU together in a heterogeneous computingmodel. The sequential part of the application runs on the CPU and the computationally-intensive part runs on the GPU. From the userÂ¶s perspective, the application just runs faster because it isusing the high-performance of the GPU to boost performance. Computing is evolving from"central processing" on the CPU to "co-processing" on the CPU and GPU. To enable this newcomputing paradigm, \textbf{NVIDIA invented the CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture)} parallel computing architecture.\\\\

The \textbf{NVIDIA \textregistered Tesla 20-series} is designed from the groundup for high performance computing. Based on the next generation CUDA GPU architecture. When compared to the latest quad-core CPU, Tesla 20-series GPU computingprocessors deliver equivalent performance at \textbf{1/20th the power consumption and 1/10th the cost} i.e. \textbf{it gives thepower of super computer in a pc based workstation.}

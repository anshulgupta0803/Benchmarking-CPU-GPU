\chapter{Conclusion}

\section{Project Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item The project is not complete in its entireity as a lot more modules can be implemented. We tried to implement the Brute Force technique but due to time boundation we were not able to implement it.
\item Some of the benchmarking tools could not be implemented due to insufficient resources.
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Intentions with the project}
\begin{itemize}
\item It has been quite a learning process and the project made can surely undergo a lot of modiÔ¨Åcations to become a well equipped parallelizer.
\item We would continue this to make sure that Brute Force (MD5 Hashing) is implemented and a bit of more study of how can this be improved would be done.
\end{itemize}

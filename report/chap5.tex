\section{The Task}
The objective of the program is simple. Itâ€™s the brute force euclidian distance transform. Basically, in a binary image, for each pixel in the foreground we verify what is the 2D euclidian distance to the nearest pixel in the background.

\section{Code Walkthrough}
Code Walkthrough mentioned in file codewalkthrough.
\section{Result}
\subsection{Output}
It took about 35.8 seconds for a 1 megapixel image in a Tesla C2050 GPU and about 1 hour on normal CPU.\\\\

\section{Inferences}
\begin{itemize}
\item From this it could be inferred that brute force ran fast on GPU rather than CPU.
